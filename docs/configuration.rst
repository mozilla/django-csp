Configuring django-csp
======================

Content-Security-Policy_ is a complicated header. There are many values
you may need to tweak here.

It's worth reading the latest CSP spec_ and making sure you understand it
before configuring django-csp.

.. note::
   Many settings require a ``tuple`` or ``list``. You may get very strange
   policies and even errors when mistakenly configuring them as a ``string``.


Migrating from django-csp <= 3.8
================================

Version 4.0 of django-csp introduces a new configuration format that breaks compatibility with
previous versions.  If you are migrating from django-csp 3.8 or lower, you will need to update your
settings to the new format. See the :ref:`migration guide <migration-guide-chapter>` for more
information.

Configuration
=============

All configuration of django-csp is done in your Django settings file with the
``CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY`` setting or the ``CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY`` setting. Each of these
settings expects a dictionary representing a policy.

The ``CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY`` setting is your enforcable policy.

The ``CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY`` setting is your report-only policy. This policy is
used to test the policy without breaking the site. It is useful when setting this policy to be
slightly more strict than the default policy to see what would be blocked if the policy was enforced.

The following is an example of a policy configuration with a default policy and a report-only
policy. The default policy is considered a "relaxed" policy that allows for the most flexibility
while still providing a good level of security. The report-only policy is considered a step towards
a more slightly strict policy and is used to test the policy without breaking the site.

.. code-block:: python

    CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = {
        "EXCLUDE_URL_PREFIXES": ["/excluded-path/"],
        "DIRECTIVES": {
            "default-src": ["'self'", "cdn.example.net"],
            "frame-ancestors": ["'self'"],
            "form-action": ["'self'"],
            "report-uri": "/csp-report/",
        },
    }

    CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY = {
        "EXCLUDE_URL_PREFIXES": ["/excluded-path/"],
        "DIRECTIVES": {
            "default-src": ["'none'"],
            "connect-src": ["'self'"],
            "img-src": ["'self'"],
            "form-action": ["'self'"],
            "frame-ancestors": ["'self'"],
            "script-src": ["'self'"],
            "style-src": ["'self'"],
            "upgrade-insecure-requests": True,
            "report-uri": "/csp-report/",
        },
    }


Policy Settings
===============

At the top level of the policy dictionary, these are the keys that can be used to configure the
policy.

``EXCLUDE_URL_PREFIXES``
    A ``tuple`` of URL prefixes. URLs beginning with any of these will not get the CSP headers.
    *()*

    .. warning::

       Excluding any path on your site will eliminate the benefits of CSP everywhere on your site.
       The typical browser security model for JavaScript considers all paths alike. A Cross-Site
       Scripting flaw on, e.g., ``excluded-page/`` can therefore be leveraged to access everything
       on the same origin.

       # TODO: I can't find any documentation on the above warning.

``REPORT_PERCENTAGE``
    Percentage of requests that should see the ``report-uri`` directive.
    Use this to throttle the number of CSP violation reports made to your
    ``report-uri``. An **integer** between 0 and 100 (0 = no reports at all).
    Ignored if ``report-uri`` isn't set.

``DIRECTIVES``
    A dictionary of policy directives. Each key in the dictionary is a directive and the value is a
    list of sources for that directive. The following is a list of all the directives that can be
    configured.

    .. note::
       The "special" source values of ``'self'``, ``'unsafe-inline'``, ``'unsafe-eval'``,
       ``'none'`` and hash-source (``'sha256-...'``) must be quoted!
       e.g.: ``"default-src": ["'self'"]``. Without quotes they will not work as intended.

    .. note::
       Deprecated features of CSP in general have been moved to the bottom of this list.

    .. warning::
       The ``'unsafe-inline'`` and ``'unsafe-eval'`` sources are considered harmful and should be
       avoided. They are included here for completeness, but should not be used in production.

    ``default-src``
        Set the ``default-src`` directive. A ``tuple`` or ``list`` of values,

    ``frame-ancestors``
        Set the ``frame-ancestors`` directive. A ``tuple`` or ``list``. *None*

        Note: This doesn't use ``default-src`` as a fall-back.

    ``form-action``
        Set the ``FORM_ACTION`` directive. A ``tuple`` or ``list``. *None*

        Note: This doesn't use ``default-src`` as a fall-back.

    ``sandbox``

        group. *None*

        See Section 1.2: https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#group

        Also `see this MDN note on <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri>`_ ``report-uri`` and ``report-to``.

        Set the ``manifest-src`` directive. A ``tuple`` or ``list``. *None*

        Valid values: a ``list`` containing ``'script'``, ``'style'``, or both.

        Spec: require-sri-for-known-tokens_

    ``upgrade-insecure-requests``
        Include ``upgrade-insecure-requests`` directive. A ``boolean``. *False*

        Spec: upgrade-insecure-requests_

    ``require-trusted-types-for``

        Include ``trusted-types`` directive.
        A ``tuple`` or ``list``. *None*

        Valid values: a ``list`` of allowed policy names that may include
        ``default`` and/or ``'allow-duplicates'``

    ``include-nonce-in``
        A ``tuple`` of directives to include a nonce in. *['default-src']*  Any directive that is 
        included in this list will have a nonce value added to it of the form ``'nonce-{nonce-value}'``.

        Note: This is a bit of a "pseudo"-directive. It's not a real CSP directive as defined by the
        spec, but it's used to determine which directives should include a nonce value. This is
        useful for adding nonces to scripts and styles.

        Note: The nonce value will only be generated if ``request.csp_nonce`` is accessed during the
        request/response cycle.

The following ``DIRECTIVES`` settings are still configurable, but are considered deprecated
in terms of the latest implementation of the relevant spec.


``block-all-mixed-content``
    Include ``block-all-mixed-content`` directive. A ``boolean``. *False*

    Related `note on MDN <block-all-mixed-content_mdn_>`_.

    Spec: block-all-mixed-content_


``plugin-types``
    Set the ``plugin-types`` directive. A ``tuple`` or ``list``. *None*

    Note: This doesn't use ``default-src`` as a fall-back.

    Related `note on MDN <plugin_types_mdn_>`_.


``prefetch-src``

Changing the Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The policy can be changed on a per-view (or even per-request) basis. See
the :ref:`decorator documentation <decorator-chapter>` for more details.
