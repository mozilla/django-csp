CHANGES
=======

4.0
===

This release contains several breaking changes. For a complete migration guide, see:
https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migration-guide.html

## Breaking Changes

- **Configuration Format**: Moved to dict-based configuration which allows for setting policies for
both enforced and report-only. Instead of using individual settings with `CSP_` prefixes, you now
use dictionaries called `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` and/or `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY`.
([#219](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/219))

  You can use Django's check command to automatically identify existing CSP settings and generate a
  template for the new configuration format:

  ```
  python manage.py check
  ```

  This will detect your old `CSP_` prefixed settings and output a draft of the new dict-based
  configuration, giving you a starting point for migration.

  **Example:**

  Change from:
  ```python
  CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ["'self'", "*.example.com"]
  CSP_SCRIPT_SRC = ["'self'", "js.cdn.com/example/"]
  CSP_IMG_SRC = ["'self'", "data:", "example.com"]
  CSP_EXCLUDE_URL_PREFIXES = ["/admin"]
  ```

  to:
  ```python
  from csp.constants import SELF

  CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = {
      "DIRECTIVES": {
          "default-src": [SELF, "*.example.com"],
          "script-src": [SELF, "js.cdn.com/example/"],
          "img-src": [SELF, "data:", "example.com"],
      },
      "EXCLUDE_URL_PREFIXES": ["/admin"],
  }
  ```

- **Nonce Configuration**: Switched from specifying directives that should contain nonces as a
separate list to using a sentinel `NONCE` value in the directive itself.
([#223](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/223))

  **Example:**

  Change from:
  ```python
  CSP_INCLUDE_NONCE_IN = ['script-src', 'style-src']
  ```

  to:
  ```python
  from csp.constants import NONCE, SELF

  CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = {
      "DIRECTIVES": {
          "script-src": [SELF, NONCE],
          "style-src": [SELF, NONCE],
      }
  }
  ```

- **Nonce Behavior**: Changed how `request.csp_nonce` works - it is now Falsy
(`bool(request.csp_nonce)`) until it is read as a string (e.g., used in a template or with
`str(request.csp_nonce)`). Previously, it always tested as `True`, and testing generated the nonce.
([#270](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/270))

  **Before:**
  ```python
  # The nonce was generated when this was evaluated
  if request.csp_nonce:
      # Do something with nonce
  ```

  **After:**
  ```python
  # This won't generate the nonce, and will evaluate to False until nonce is read as a string
  if request.csp_nonce:
      # This code won't run until nonce is used as a string

  # To generate and use the nonce
  nonce_value = str(request.csp_nonce)
  ```

- Dropped support for Django â‰¤3.2.
- Dropped support for Python 3.8.

## New Features and Improvements

- **Dual Policy Support**: Added support for enforced and report-only policies simultaneously using
the separate `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY` and `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY` settings.

  **Example:**
  ```python
  from csp.constants import NONE, SELF

  # Enforced policy
  CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = {
      "DIRECTIVES": {
          "default-src": [SELF, "cdn.example.net"],
          "frame-ancestors": [SELF],
      },
  }

  # Report-only policy (stricter for testing)
  CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_REPORT_ONLY = {
      "DIRECTIVES": {
          "default-src": [NONE],
          "script-src": [SELF],
          "style-src": [SELF],
          "report-uri": "https://example.com/csp-report/",
      },
  }
  ```

- **CSP Constants**: Added CSP keyword constants in `csp.constants` (e.g., `SELF` instead of
`"'self'"`) to minimize quoting mistakes and typos.
([#222](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/222))

  **Example:**

  Change from:
  ```python
  CSP_DEFAULT_SRC = ["'self'", "'none'"]
  ```

  to:
  ```python
  from csp.constants import SELF, NONE

  CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY = {
      "DIRECTIVES": {
          "default-src": [SELF, NONE],  # No need to worry about quoting
      }
  }
  ```

- Added comprehensive type hints. ([#228](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/228))
- Added `EXCLUDE_URL_PREFIXES` check not a string. ([#252](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/252))
- Added support for CSP configuration as sets. ([#251](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/251))
- Changed `REPORT_PERCENTAGE` to be a float between `0.0` and `100.0` and improved behavior for 100%
report percentage to always send CSP reports.
- Added ability to read the nonce after response if it was included in the header. This will raise
an error when nonce is accessed after response if not already generated.
([#269](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/269))
- Made changes to simplify middleware logic and make `CSPMiddleware` easier to subclass. The updated
middleware returns a PolicyParts dataclass that can be modified before the policy is built.
([#237](https://github.com/mozilla/django-csp/pull/237))

## Other Changes

- Added Python 3.13 support.
- Added support for Django 5.1 and 5.2.
- Documentation improvements including fixed trusted_types links and clarification on NONE vs Python's None.
- Documentation note that reporting percentage needs rate limiting middleware.
- Expanded ruff configuration and moved into pyproject.toml.
